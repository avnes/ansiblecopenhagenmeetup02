# Platform as a Service

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud service that gives you a ready platform to develop, run and manage applications. The overhead of installing and operating the underlying hardware, operating system and software is done by the cloud provider. As the customer of the PaaS subscription you can focus on developing, deploying and running your application, while the cloud vendor takes care of security patching and software updates.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) on the other hand makes you able to create virtual machines, network resources and storage solutions. This can be useful if you need to use software that is not provided as a platform service.

Today I will share my experience with using Ansible for provisioning PaaS resources on Microsoft Azure.
