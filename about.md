# About me

Name: **Audun V. Nes**

I am working as a Systems Engineer and Tech Lead for Ansible in an agile build team where we develop and maintain the CI/CD pipeline for Maersk Transport & Logistics One Technology Application Development. We are about 25 employees and 5+ contractors on the team, and we are geographically located in Copenhagen, Denmark and Maidenhead, United Kingdom.

For the past year I have been spending 80% of my time on a commercial project where I do CI/CD pipeline work to support Angular and Spring Boot developers. We also do platform work by automating the provisioning of Microsoft Azure PaaS services like:

* Azure Alerts
* Azure App Services
* Azure Application Gateway
* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Container Registry
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure DNS
* Azure Event Grid
* Azure Insights
* Azure SQL Server and Elastic Pool
* Azure Storage Account
* Azure Web Apps for Containers

Ansible, Jinja2 Azure Resource Manager templates are our configuration management and automation tools on the project. We use Jenkins for continuous integration. We strive to automate everything.
